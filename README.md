# Escape - Dolls

There is a side project inspired by the puzzle board game: "Unlock." The story begins with a man who is abducted and
awakes in a locked room surrounded by dolls. He doesn't know why he is in such a place but wants to escape from the
room.

Could you help him to get out of this place?
